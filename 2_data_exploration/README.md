# Materials
Take a look into data quality related issues in real life: https://hbr.org/2018/04/if-your-data-is-bad-your-machine-learning-tools-are-useless.  

Study sections 12.1. Describing Single Variables and 12.2.2 Correlations Between Quantitative Variables from [Research Methods article](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_research-methods-in-psychology/) (feel free to skip the Differences Between Groups or Conditions section).   

Familiarize yourself with the seaborn library: https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html.  
Take this mini-course to get more hands-on: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization. Don't miss the exercises!  
Get acquainted with boxplots: https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-boxplots-5e2df7bcbd51.  

Install and experiment with the [pandas_profiling library](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/master/rtd/pages/introduction.html)

Bonus task: explore the https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations site (and if intrigued, read https://hbr.org/2015/06/beware-spurious-correlations).

# Exercises for self-training
Perform a comprehensive exploration of this dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult _without_ using the pandas_profiling library first. Refer to https://github.com/cmawer/pycon-2017-eda-tutorial/blob/master/EDA-cheat-sheet.md for structuring your approach. Feel free to draw inspiration from this example: https://towardsdatascience.com/lets-learn-exploratory-data-analysis-practically-4a923499b779.
Then apply pandas_profiling, check for new findings and fill the gaps in your earlier analysis.
